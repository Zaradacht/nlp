I'm back, in full effect
I can't even hold myself erect
I got nothing, that I wanna say
I'm gonna say it, anyway
I know you think that I've lost it baby
I know you think that my star is fading
You used to be a contender, now you're just a pretender
Psychic karaoke every weekend
You don't fit in those clothes anymore
Why don't you take them back to the charity store?
While you're there, you can always hand yourself in
You're into green issues, start recycling
You hide behind your woman when you're out on the town
Sure wouldn't blame her for holding you down
Holding you down, holding you down
You're the only one who's holding you down
You're only ever polite when you're out of your box

Cocker's short for sucker...
A sucker of...
Oooh oooh ooooh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Oooh oooh ooooh
A sucker of...
Oooh oooh ooooh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Oooh oooh ooooh

When I got up today I had that feeling again
Everything was okay then the world started seeping in
Now I'm trying to sleep it away
Oh but I can't sleep it away
Can you answer this question can you answer it right?
Have you ever done anything good in your life?
Have you ever done anything that wasn't just for yourself?
Are you capable of giving?
Are you capable of giving just for the sake of it
Without expecting anything in return?

I'm only trying to give you waht you've come to expect
Just another song about single mothers and sex
Single mothers and sex
Single mothers and sex
Just another song about single mothers and sex
OK, you've heard it before;
It's nothing special
But it's a living, can't you see?
I'm a professional

Oooh oooh ooooh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Oooh oooh ooooh
Yeah, I'm a professional
Oooh oooh ooooh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Oooh oooh ooooh

Sleep on my darling
Sleep on don't wake as I leave
I've been rehearsing this scene so long now;
Don't interupt me as I do it for real
The bedroom floor is treacherous
A tea-cup could be disastrous;
Cos that would mean I would have to say
What is written in the letter I posted yesterday
So that it would get here when I was gone
And you awoke

Oh, she will meet me from the train
And she won't know a thing
About how I talk with my mouth full and only bath once a week
How I'm nicer the first time you meet me than the next
And I'm rapidly losing interest in sex
Yeah I'm rapidly losing interest in sex
What's the point in making it over-emotioanl?
You can do it the hard way
Or you can be a professional

Oooh oooh ooooh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Oooh oooh ooooh
I'm a professional
Oooh oooh ooooh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
Oooh oooh ooooh

(Okay)

Sleep on my darling
Sleep on my love
Sleep on my darling
Sleep on my love
Sleep on my darling
Sleep on my love etc
