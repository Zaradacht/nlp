Help the aged
One time they were just like you
Drinking, smoking cigs and sniffing glue
Help the aged
Don't just put them in a home
Can't have much fun in there all on their own
Give a hand, if you can
Try and help them to unwind
Give them hope and give them comfort
'Cos they're running out of time

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realise?
Oh, it's time you took an older lover baby
Teach you stuff, although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

Help the aged
'Cos one day you'll be older too
You might need someone who can pull you through
And if you look very hard
Behind those lines upon their face
You may see where you are headed
And it's such a lonely place

Oh, in the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realise?
It's time you took an older lover, baby
Teach you stuff, although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

You can dye your hair but it's the one thing you can't change
Can't run away from yourself
Yourself, your-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-self

In the meantime we try
Try to forget that nothing lasts forever
No big deal, so give us all a feel
Funny how it all falls away
When did you first realise?
It's time you took an older lover baby
Teach you stuff, although he's looking rough
Funny how it all falls away

Oh, it's funny how it all falls away
Funny how it all falls away
Oh, it's funny how it all
It all falls away
So help the aged
