Tomorrow never lies
So live for today
Don't be afraid
Of the skeletons
Of yesterday
Each morning brings you closer to your goal
So grab your chance, don't let it go
The city streets are littered
With the casualties
The could haves
The should haves
And the would've beens
Don't let this chance slip by

Because
Tomorrow never lies
Tomorrow never lies
No it's never gonna lie
If you live tomorrow today
There are those
Who would shoot you down
There's always someone wants to
Shoot you down
But you know
They're never gonna be able to shoot you down
If you live tomorrow today
If you live tomorrow today
If you live tomorrow today

The night time blazes
With all your nightmares come to life
But you can face the danger
Knowing that your cause is right
And leave them all below you, bleeding as you rise
Into the night

Because you know
Tomorrow never lies
Tomorrow never lies
No, it's never gonna lie
If you live tomorrow today
There are those who would
Shoot you down
There's always someone wants to shoot you down
But you know they're never gonna be able to
Shoot you down
Oh, if you live tomorrow today
If you live tomorrow today
If you live tomorrow today
Cos you, you gotta live tomorrow today
Live it
Because...
Tomorrow never lies
Tomorrow never lies
Tomorrow never lies
Tomorrow never lies
No no no no no
