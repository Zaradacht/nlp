The dust has settled
Replaced the bulbs in all the lights
Well, I guess I'll get no sleep tonight
A revolution happened
Oh sorry, you haven't heard?
We are the children of the new world

If you're quiet you can watch if you like
They say the future's beginning tonight
Whole empires will crumble, civilisations will fall
Lie on the bed hear the sound of it all
No anger, no guilt and no sorrow
It sounds unlikely, I know, but tomorrow
You will wake up to find that your whole life has changed
Although nothing looks different, a revolution took place

I love the way you do it
I love the way you put them on
You know the answers but you get it wrong
(Just to confuse things)
Why did it seem so difficult
To realise a simple truth?
The revolution begins and ends with you

Now all your breakdowns and nightmares look small
Now we decided not to die after all
Cause the meek shall inherit absolutely nothing at all
If you stopped being so feeble, you could have so much more
The answer was here all the time, you see
Just how I missed it is a mystery to me
I have waited and waited for this day to arrive
The revolution was televised, now it's over, bye bye
It's over, bye bye
It's over, bye bye

Yeah, you made it
Just by the skin of your teeth
Perfection is over (The Rave is over)
Sheffield is over
The Fear is over
Guilt is over (Please leave the building quietly)
Soul is over
Bergerac is over
The hangover is over
Men are over, women are over
Cholesterol is over
Tapers are over
The breakdown is over
Irony is over
Bye bye
Bye bye
