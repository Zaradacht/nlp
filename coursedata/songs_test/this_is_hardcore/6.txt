Without you my life has become
A hangover without end
A movie made for TV
Bad dialogue, bad acting, no interest
Too long with no story and no sex

Is it a kind of weakness
To miss someone so much?
To wish the day would go away?
Like you did yesterday
Just like you did yesterday

And I can't think of a way to get through this pain
To be happy again, to make it all alright
And I know it must be bad, 'cause sitting here right now
All I know is I can't even think
I can't even think of anything clever to say
To say, so I say...

Why pretend any longer?
'Cause I need you here with me
It's obvious that I miss you so much
So please say you're gonna stay
So please say you're gonna stay
So please say you're gonna stay

The night is getting darker
Now and there's nothing on TV
But I'll sit tight 'til morning light
Yeah, I'll wait until the day
Until the day that you say you're gonna
Stay
