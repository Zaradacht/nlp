Don't bother saying you're sorry
Why don't you come in?
Smoke all my cigarettes again
Every time I get no further
How long has it been?
Come on in now
Wipe your feet on my dreams


You take up my time
Like some cheap magazine
When I could have been learning something
Oh well, you know what I mean
I've done this before
And I will do it again
Come on and kill me, baby
While you smile like a friend
Oh, and I'll come running
Just to do it again


You are that last drink I never should have drunk
You are the body hidden in the trunk
You are the habit I can't seem to kick
You are my secrets on the front page every week
You are the car I never should have bought
You are the train I never should have caught
You are the cut that makes me hide my face
You are the party that makes me feel my age
And like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid
Like a plane I've been told I never should board
Like a film that's so bad but I gotta stay till the end
Let me tell you now, it's lucky for you that we're friends
