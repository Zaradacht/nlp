I am not Jesus, though I have the same initials
I am the man who stays home and does the dishes
And how was your day?
Is that woman still trying to do your head in?
A man told me to beware of 33
He said, "It was not an easy time for me"
But I'll get through
Even though I've got no miracles to show you

I'd like to make this water wine
But it's impossible
I've got to get these dishes dry

I'll read a story if it helps you sleep at night
I got some matches if you ever need a light
Oh, I am just a man
But I'm doing what I can to help you

I'd like to make this water wine
But it's impossible
I've got to get these dishes dry

And I, I'm not worried
That I will never touch the stars
'Cos stars belong up in heaven
And the earth is where we are
Oh yeah

And aren't you happy just to be alive?
Anything's possible
You've got no cross to bear tonight
No, not tonight
No, not tonight

I'm not Jesus though I have the same initials
