I used to try very hard to make friends
With everyone on the planet
I've seen you having it, having it
But now you've just had it
Entertainment can sometimes be hard
When the thing that you love
Is the same thing that's holding you down

Oh, this man is dangerous
He just shed his load on your best party frock
Before you enter the palace of wisdom
You have to decide, are you ready to rock?
Hmm, can you party with me?
Can you show me a good time?
Do you even know what one looks like?

And I don't need to hear your stories again
Just get on the floor and show me
Show me what you're made of
Just what exactly are you made of?

Baby, you're driving me crazy
Baby, you're driving me crazy

I was having a whale of a time
Until your uncle, your uncle Psychosis arrived
Why do we have to half kill ourselves
Just to prove we're alive?
I'm here whenever you need me
And whenever you need me
Well, I won't be here

And do you ever stop to ask yourself
If you didn't come to party
Then why did you come here?
Then why did you come here?

Baby, you're driving me crazy
Baby, you're driving me crazy

And do you really know want to know
Just how come you turned out so dumb?

When the party's over will you come home with me?
When the party's over will you come home with me?
Now the party's over will you come home to me?
Will you come home to me?
Will you come home to me?
Will you come home to me?
