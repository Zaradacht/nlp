Laid here with the advertising sliding past my eyes
Like cartoons from other people's lives
I start to wonder what it takes to be a man, mm
Well, I learned to drink, and I learned to smoke
And I learned to tell a dirty joke
Oh, if that's all there is then there's no point for me

Oh, so please can I ask just why we're alive?
'Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man
Tell me 'bout it
Your car can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a man

So you stumble into town and hold your stomach in
Show them what you've got though they've seen everything
Yeah, you're a beauty but they've seen your type before
You've got no need but still you want
So go and book that restaurant
The wine will flow and then you'll just fly away

Oh, so please can I ask just why we're alive?
'Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man
Tell me 'bout it
Your car can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a man

Oh, tell me 'bout it
And please can I ask just why we're alive?
'Cos all that you do seems such a waste of time
And if you hang around too long you'll be a man
Oh tell, c'mon, tell me 'bout it
Your car can get up to a hundred and ten
You've nowhere to go but you'll go there again
And nothing ever makes no difference to a man
To a man
To a man
To a man
That's what I am
