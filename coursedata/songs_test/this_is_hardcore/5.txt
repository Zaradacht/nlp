You are hardcore, you make me hard
You name the drama and I'll play the part
It seems I saw you in some teenage wet dream
I like your get up if you know what I mean

I want it bad
I want it now
Oh, can't you see
I'm ready now?

I've seen all the pictures, I studied them forever
I wanna make a movie so let's star in it together, oh oh
Don't make a move 'til I say, "Action."

Oh, here comes the Hardcore life

Put your money where your mouth is tonight
Leave your make-up on and I'll leave on the light
Come over here, babe, and talk in the mic
Oh yeah, I hear you now, it's gonna be one hell of a night

You can't be a spectator, oh no
You gotta take these dreams and make them whole

Oh, this is Hardcore
There is no way back for you
Oh, this is Hardcore
This is me on top of you
And I can't believe that it took me this long
(That it took me this long)

Oh, this
Is the eye of the storm
It's what men in stained raincoats pay for
But in here it is pure, yeah
This
Is the end of the line
I've seen the storyline
Played out so many times before

Oh, that goes in there
Then that goes in there
And that goes in there
And that goes in there, ooh
And then it's over

Oh, what a hell of a show
But what I want to know:
What exactly do you do for an encore, yeah?
'Cos this is Hardcore
