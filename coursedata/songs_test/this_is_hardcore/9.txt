Here in the night, love takes control
Making me high, making me whole


Here in the night, love takes control
Making me high, making me whole

I don't know
Oh, no, no, no
No, I don't know
No, no, no
No, I don't know


When I close my eyes I can see
You lowering yourself to my level
I don't know where you got those clothes
But you can take them off if it makes you feel better


Don't stop it now
Now is so right
Now as the day slips away
And we slide into night

I don't know
Oh, no, no, no
No, I don't know
No, no, no
No, I don't know


I open my eyes and you're there
Even better in the flesh, it would seem
I'm so ready and willing and able it's untrue
To act out this love scene
And make my dreams come true, yeah

And how many others have touched themselves
Whilst looking at pictures of you?
How many others could handle it if all their dreams came true?
I don't expect you to answer straight away
Maybe you're just having an off day
But I need to believe in you
Yes, I do, yes, I do


Here in my heart
Here in my head
Live all your dreams for tonight
Here in your bed

I don't know
Oh, no, no, no
No, I don't know
No, no, no
No, I don't know


So roll the soundtrack and dim the lights
'Cos I'm not going home tonight
This love scene has begun
So let's get it on

Lets make this the greatest love scene
From a play no one's thought up yet
I know you're feeling the same as me
Although what you gonna do about it?
Now here's an exclusive
I've wanted you for years I only needed the balls to admit it
When the unbelievable object meets the unstoppable force
There's nothing you can do about it
No

I will light your cigarette
With a star that has fallen from the sky
Breath in, breath out, I love the way you move
Don't let anyone tell you any different tonight
You are beauty, you are class, you showed it all
But you still kept a little piece back just for me
A little piece back just for me, just for me (just for me)

I don't know how you do it
But I love the way you do it
When your doing it to me


(Na-na-na-na, na-na, na, na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na, na-na, na, na-na-na) And if this is a dream
Then I'm gonna sleep for the rest of my life


For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
