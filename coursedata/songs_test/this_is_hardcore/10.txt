You look just like Sylvia
Well, you look like her to me
The way she wore her hair then
Oh, the way she used to be
I've not seen her for a long time
Though I've heard she's still around
Her father's living with some girl
Who's a year younger than her


She's living in the country now, yeah
Oh, she's trying to get better
Her beauty was her only crime
Yeah, I remember Sylvia


So keep believing and do what you do
I can't help you but I know things are gonna get better
And please stop asking what it's got to do with you
Oh, keep believing 'cos you know that you deserve better


Who's this man you're talking to?
Can't you see what he wants to do?
He thinks if he stands near enough
Then he will look as good as you
Oh, he don't care about your problems
He just wants to show his friends
I guess I'm just the same as him
Oh, I just didn't know it then


I never understood you, really
And I know it's too late now
You didn't ask to be that way
Oh, I'm sorry Sylvia


So keep believing and do what you do
I can't help you but I know things are gonna get better
And please stop asking what it's got to do with you
Oh, keep believing 'cos you know that you deserve better
Oh, it's true, yeah




So please stop asking what it's got to do with you
Oh, keep believing 'cos you know that you deserve better
Oh yeah, you know that you deserve better
Oh yeah, you know that you deserve better
Oh, Sylvia
