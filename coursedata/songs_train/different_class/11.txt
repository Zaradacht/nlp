There's nothing to do, so you just stay in bed
Oh, poor thing
Why live in the world when you can live in your head?
Mm, and you can go out late from Monday
Till Saturday turns into Sunday
And now we're back here at Monday
So you can do it all over again

And we go
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah

Ah, I want a refund
I want a light
I want a reason
To make it through the night, alright

And so you finally left school
So now what are you going to do?
Now you're so grown up
Yeah, you're oh oh oh oh oh so mature oh

Going out late from Monday
Ch-ch-chuck up in the street on Sunday
You don't wanna live till Monday
You're gonna do it all over again

And you go
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah
Aah ah ah, aah ah ah

I want a refund
I want a light
And I want a reason for all this
Night after night after night after night, ow
Oh, I know that it's stupid
But I just can't seem to spend a night at home
'Cos my friends left town and I'm here all alone, ho, ho

Yeah
They say the past must die for the future to be born
In that case die little, die
(Ho ho ho hoo, oh)
(Ho ho ho hoo, oh)
(Ho ho ho hoo, oh)
C'mon, aah

Stomach in, chest out
On your marks, get set, go

Now, now that you're free, what are you gonna be?
And who are you gonna see?
And where, where will you go? And how will you know?
You didn't get it all wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong
Is this the light of a new day dawning?
A future bright that you can walk in
No, it's just another Monday morning
Do it all over again, oh baby

La, la la la la la
A-la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh, oh, oh
La la, la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Oh, oh, oh
