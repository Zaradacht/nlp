I wrote this song two hours before we met
I didn't know your name or what you looked like yet
Oh, I could have stayed at home and gone to bed
I could have gone to see a film instead


You might have changed your mind and seen your friend
Life could have been very different but then
Something changed


Do you believe that there's someone up above?
And does he have a timetable directing acts of love?
Why did I write this song on that one day?
Why did you touch my hand and softly say


"Stop asking questions that don't matter anyway
Just give us a kiss to celebrate here today"
Something changed


Oh, when we woke up that morning we had no way of knowing
That in a matter of hours, we'd change the way we were going
Where would I be now


Where would I be now if we'd never met
Would I be singing this song to someone else instead
I don't know, but like you just said:
Something changed
