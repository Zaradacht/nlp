Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits
Raised on a diet of broken biscuits, oh
Oh, we don't look the same as you
And we don't do the things you do
But we live 'round here too, oh really

Mis-shapes, mistakes, misfits
We'd like to go to town but we can't risk it, oh
'Cause they just want to keep us out
You could end up with a smack in the mouth
Just for standing out, now really

Brothers, sisters, can't you see?
The future's owned by you and me
There won't be fighting in the street
They think they've got us beat
But revenge is going to be so sweet

We're making a move, we're making it now
We're coming out of the side-lines
Just put your hands up - it's a raid, yeah
We want your homes, we want your lives
We want the things you won't allow us
We won't use guns, we won't use bombs
We'll use the one thing we've got more of -
That's our minds

Check your lucky numbers
How much money could drag you under? Oh
Oh, what's the point of being rich
If you can't think what to do with it?
'Cause you're so bleedin' thick

Oh, we weren't supposed to be
We learnt too much at school
Now we can't help but see
That the future that you've got mapped out is
Nothing much to shout about

We're making a move, we're making it now
We're coming out of the side-lines
Just put your hands up - it's a raid yeah
We want your homes, we want your lives
We want the things you won't allow us
We won't use guns, we won't use bombs
We'll use the one thing we've got more of -
That's our minds

Brothers, sisters, can't you see?
The future's owned by you and me
There won't be fighting in the street
They think they've got us beat
But revenge is going to be so sweet

We're making a move. We're making it now
We're coming out of the sidelines
Just put your hands up - it's a raid
We want your homes, we want your lives
We want the things you won't allow us
We won't use guns, we won't use bombs
We'll use the one thing we've got more of -
That's our minds, yeah
That's our minds, yeah
