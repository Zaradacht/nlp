I spy a boy
I spy a girl
I spy the worst place
In the world
In the whole wide world
Oh, you didn't do bad
You made it out
I'm still stuck here
Oh, but I'll get out
Oh yeah, I'll get out

Can't you see the giant that walks around you
Seeing through your petty lives?
Do you think I do these things for real?
I do these things just so I survive
And you know I will survive
It may look to the untrained eye
I'm sitting on my arse all day
I'm biding time until I take you all on
My Lords and Ladies
I will prevail
I cannot fail
Cause I spy

Oh, I've got your number, taken notes
I know the ways your minds work, I've studied
Oh, and your minds are just the same as mine
Except that you're clever swines
You never let your mask slip, you never admit to it
You're never hurried
Oh no, no, no
And every night I hone my plan
How I will get my satisfaction
How I will blow your paradise away
Away, away
Cause I spy

And it's just like in the old days
I used to compose my own critical notices in my head
"The crowd gasp at Cocker's masterful control of the bicycle
Skillfully avoiding the dog turd outside the corner shop."
Imagining a blue plaque
Above the place I first ever touched a girl's chest
But hold on
You've got to wait for the best
You see, you should take me seriously
Very seriously indeed
'Cause I've been sleeping with your wife
For the past sixteen weeks
Smoking your cigarettes, drinking your brandy
Messing up the bed that you chose together
And in all that time
I just wanted you to come home unexpectedly one afternoon
And catch us at it in the front room

You see, I spy for a living
And I specialize in revenge
On taking the things I know will cause you pain
I can't help it, I was dragged up
My favorite parks are car parks
Grass is something you smoke, birds are something you shag
Take your "Year in Provence" and shove it up your ass

Your Ladbroke Grove looks turn me on, yeah
With roach burns in designer dresses
Skin stretched tight over high cheek-bones
And thousands of tiny dryness lines beating a path
Beating a path to the corners of your eyes
And every night I hatch my plan
It's not a case of woman V man
It's more a case of haves against haven'ts
And I just happen to have got what you need
And just exactly what you need, yeah

La la la la la la la la la la
In the midnight hour
La la la la la la la la la la
I will come to you
I will come to you
I will take you from this sickness
Dinner parties and champagne
I'll hold your body and make it sing again
Come on sing again, let's sing again, oh yeah
Cause I spy
Yes, I spy

I spy a boy
And I spy a girl
I spy the chance
To change the world
To change your world
