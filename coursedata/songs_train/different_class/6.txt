She doesn't have to go to work
But she doesn't want to stay in bed
'Cause it's changed from something comfortable
To something else instead


This bed has seen it all
From the first time to the last
The silences of now
And the good times of the past
And it only cost ten pounds
From a shop just down the road
Mind you that was seven years ago
And things were very different then


It didn't get much rest at first
The headboard banging in the night
The neighbours didn't dare complain
Oh, everything was going right


And now there's no need to complain
'Cause it never makes a sound
Something beautiful left town
And she doesn't even know its name


Now every night she plays a sad game
Ooh, ooh ooh
Called pretending nothing's going wrong
Ooh
Oh, but she knows
If this show was televised
No one would watch it
Not tonight but seven years ago
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la


Now there's no need to complain
'Cause it never makes a sound
Something beautiful left town
And she doesn't even know its name


She doesn't have to go to work
But she doesn't want to stay in bed
'Cause it's changed from something comfortable
To something else instead
