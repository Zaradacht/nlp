Oh, we were born within one hour of each other
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
Your name is Deborah, Deborah
It never suited ya
And they said that when we grew up
We'd get married and never split up
Oh, we never did it
Although I often thought of it


Oh, Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
When I came round to call
You didn't notice me at all
And I said


Let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago


You were the first girl at school to get breasts
And Martyn said that you were the best
Oh, the boys all loved you but I was a mess
I had to watch them try and get you undressed
We were friends, that was as far as it went
I used to walk you home sometimes, but it meant
Oh, it meant nothing to you
'Cos you were so popular


Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
When I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all
And I said


Let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago


Do it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah


Oh, Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
And when I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all
And I said


Let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago


Oh, what are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
