Oh, is this the way they say the future's meant to feel?
Or just 20,000 people standing in a field
And I don't quite understand just what this feeling is
But that's okay cause we're all sorted out for E's and wizz
And tell me when the spaceship lands
'Cause all this has just got to mean something
Oh


In the middle of the night, it feels alright
But then tomorrow morning
Ooh, ooh, then you come down


Oh yeah, the pirate radio station told us what was going down
Got the tickets from some fucked up bloke in Camden Town
Oh, and no-one seems to know exactly where it is
But that's okay cause we're all sorted out for E's and wizz
At 4 o'clock the normal world seems very, very, very far away
Alright


In the middle of the night, it feels alright
But then tomorrow morning
Ooh, ooh, then you come down


Just keep on moving


Everybody asks your name they say we're all the same
And now it's "nice one", "geezer"
And that's as far as the conversation went
I lost my friends, I dance alone, it's six o'clock I wanna go home
But it's "no way", "not today", makes you wonder what it meant
And this hollow feeling grows and grows and grows and grows
And you want to call your mother and say
"Mother, I can never come home again
'Cause I seem to have left an important part of my brain
Somewhere, somewhere in a field in Hampshire"
Alright


In the middle of the night, it feels alright
But then tomorrow morning
Ooh, ooh, then you come down


Ooh, ooh, then you come down
Ooh, what if you never come down?
