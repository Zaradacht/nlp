Why don't you shut the door and close the curtains
'Cos you're not going anywhere
He's coming up the stairs and in a moment
He'll want to see your underwear


I couldn't stop it now, there's no way to get out
He's standing far too near and how the hell did you get here?
Semi-naked in somebody else's room
I'd give my whole life to see it
Just you stood there
Only in your underwear


If fashion is your trade then when you're naked
I guess you must be unemployed, yeah
But once it's underway, there's no escaping
The fact that you're a girl and he's a boy, ah


I couldn't stop it now, there's no way to get out
He's standing far too near and how the hell did you get here?
Semi-naked in somebody else's room
I'd give my whole life to see it
Just you stood there
Only in your underwear
I wanna, I wanna see you, oh


If you could close your eyes and just remember
That this is what you wanted last night
So why is it so hard for you to touch him?
For you to go and give yourself to him, oh Jesus


I couldn't stop it now, there's no way to get out
He's standing far too near and how the hell did you get here?
Semi-naked in somebody else's room
I'd give my whole life to see it
Just you stood there
Only in your underwear
Oh, come on, come on now


Oh yeah, I wanna see you
Wanna see you standing in your underwear
Oh
