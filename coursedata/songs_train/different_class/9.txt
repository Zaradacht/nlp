The room is cold
And has been like this for several months
If I close my eyes
I can visualise everything in it
Right down
Right down to the broken handle
On the third drawer down of the dressing table
And the world outside this room has also assumed a familiar shape
The same events shuffled in a slightly different order each day
Just like a modern shopping centre

And it's so cold
Yeah, it's so cold

What...
Is...
This...
Feeling called love?
Why me?
Why you?
Why here?
Why now?

It doesn't make no sense, no
It's not convenient, no
It doesn't fit my plans, no
It's something I don't understand, oh

F-E-E-L-I-N-G (And as I stand and cross the room)
C-A double L-E-D
(I feel as if my whole life has been leading to this one moment)
L-O-V-E (And as I touch your shoulder tonight)
What is this thing that is happening to me?
(This room has become the centre of the entire universe)

So what do I do?
I've got a slightly sick feeling in my stomach
Like I'm standing on the top of a very high building
Oh yeah, all the stuff they tell you about in the movies
But this isn't chocolate boxes and roses
It's dirtier than that
Like some small animal that only comes out at night
And I see flashes of the shape of your breasts
And the curve of your belly
And they make me have to sit down and catch my breath

And it's so cold
Yeah, it's so cold

What...
Is...
This...
Feeling called love?
Why me?
Why you?
Why here?
And why now?

It doesn't make no sense, no
It's not convenient, no
It doesn't fit my plans
But I got that taste in my mouth again, oh

F-E-E-L-I-N-G
(And the whole world begins to spin and spin outside the window)
C-A double L-E-D (Faster and faster and faster)
L-O-V-E (And this is the only place in focus)
What is this thing that is happening to me?
(The hook upon which everything else revolves)

(Oh yeah) F-E-E-L-I-N-G
C-A double L-E-D
L-O-V-E
What is this thing that is happening to me?

(Oh yeah) oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh
