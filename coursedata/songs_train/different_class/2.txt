When you raise your pencil skirt
Like a veil before my eyes
Like the look upon his face
As he's zipping up his flies

Oh, well, I know that you're engaged to him
Oh, but I know you want something to play with, baby

I'll be around when he's not in town, oh
Yeah, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh
I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh
Oh, it's turning me on

Now, you can tell some lies
About the good times that you've had
But I've kissed your mother twice
And now I'm working on your dad, oh, baby

I'll be around when he's not in town, oh
Oh yeah, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh
I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh ah
Oh, it's turning me on

If you look under the bed
Then I can see my house from here
So just lie against the wall
And watch my conscience disappear now, baby

I'll be around when he's not in town, oh
Oh yeah, I'll show you how you're doing it wrong, oh
I really love it when you tell me to stop, oh
Oh, it's turning me on, yeah

I only come here cause I know it makes you sad
I only do it 'cos I know you know it's bad
Oh, don't you know that it's ugly and it shouldn't be like that?
Oh but, oh, it's turning me on
