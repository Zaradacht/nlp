Now if you can stand
I would like to take you by the hand, yeah
And go for a walk
Past people as they go to work


Let's get out of this place before
They tell us that we've just died, oh


Move, move quick, you've gotta move
Come on it's through, come on it's time
Oh, look at you, you looking so confused
Just what did you lose? Oh


If you can make an order
Could you get me one?
Two sugars would be great
Cause I'm fading fast and it's nearly dawn


If they knocked down this place, this place
It'd still look much better than you, oh now


Move, move quick, you've gotta move
Come on it's through, come on it's time
Oh, look at you, you looking so confused
Just what did you lose? Oh
It's OK, it's just your mind


If we get through this alive
I'll meet you next week, same place, same time, oh


Move, move quick, you've gotta move
Come on it's through, come on it's tim
Oh, look at you, you looking so confused
Just what did you lose? Oh


That's what you get from clubbing it
You can't go home and go to bed
Because it hasn't worn off yet
And now it's morning
There's only one place we can go
It's 'round the corner in Soho
Where other broken people go
Let's go
