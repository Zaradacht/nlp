Well, it happened years ago
When you lived on Stanhope Road
We listened to your sister
When she came from school
'Cos she was two years older
And she had boys in her room
I listened outside, I heard her
Alright

Well, that was all right for a while
But soon I wanted more
I wanna see as well as hear and so I
I hid inside her wardrobe
As she came home round four
And she was with some kid called David
Oh, from the garage up the road
I listened outside, I heard her
Alright

Oh, I wanna take you home
I wanna give you children
And you might be my girlfriend
A-yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I saw you next day
I really couldn't tell
'Cos you might go and tell your mother
And so you went with Neve
Oh yeah, and Neve was coming on
And I thought I heard you laughing
When his mum and dad were gone
I listened outside, I heard you
Alright

Oh, I wanna take you home
I wanna give you children
And you might be my girlfriend
A-yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh yeah
Oh well, I guess
It couldn't last too long
I came home one day
And all her things were gone
I fell asleep inside
I never heard her come
Oh, and I opened up the wardrobe
And I had to get it on, yeah
Oh, listen
Oh, we were on the bed when you came home
I heard you stop outside the door
I know you won't believe it's true
I only went with her 'cos she looks like you
My god!

Oh, I wanna take you home
I wanna give you children
And you might be my girlfriend
A-yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
