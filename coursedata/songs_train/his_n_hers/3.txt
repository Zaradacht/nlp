I fell asleep on your sofa
And I had a dream about a small child
In dungarees, who caught his hands
In the doors of the Paris metro
Then my face cracked open and you were there
You were there dressed in green
Saying something obscene
But that's why I came here in the first place
Oh well, that and the tea, oh!

Can I stay here lying under the table together with you now?
Can I hold you forever in acrylic afternoons?
I want to hold you tight whilst children play outside
And they wait for their mothers to finish with lovers
And call them inside for their tea

Cushions and TV
And the table's set for tea
One for you, one for me
Come and lie down on the settee
In that green jumper, you can have anything you want
And the, the clock is saying that it's half past four
But you know, you know I wanna, I wanna stay a little more
I wanna stay a little more, oh!

Can I stay here lying under the table together with you, now?
Can I hold you forever in acrylic afternoons?
I want to hold you tight whilst children play outside
And they wait for their mothers to finish with lovers
And call them inside for their tea

Oh...
On a pink quilted eiderdown, I wanna
Pull your knickers down
Net curtains blowing slightly in the breeze
Lemonade light filtering through the trees
It's so soft and it's warm, just another cup of tea please
One lump, yeah - thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Woooooo!

Can I stay here lying under the table together with you now?
Can I hold you forever in acrylic afternoons?
I want to hold you tight whilst children play outside
And they wait for their mothers to finish with lovers
And call them inside for their tea

Oh, Wayne, Julie, Diane, Heather, Rachel, come home
Ooh
Uh oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
