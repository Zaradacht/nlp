No wonder you're looking thin
When all that you live on is lipgloss and cigarettes
And scraps at the end of the day
When he's given the rest to someone with long black hair
All those nights in, making such a mess of the bed
Oh, you never ever want to go home
And he wants you so you may as well hang around for a while
Call your dad on the phone, oh

He changed his mind last Monday
So you've gotta leave by Sunday, yeah

Oh, you've lost your lipgloss, honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do can turn him on
There's something wrong
You had it once but now it's gone

Oh, and you feel such a fool
For laughing at bad jokes and putting up with all of his friends
And kissing in public
What are they gonna say when they run into you again?
That your stomach looks bigger and your hair is a mess
And your eyes are just holes in your face
And it rains every day and when it doesn't
The sun makes you feel worse anyway, oh
Though you knew there was no way it was gonna last forever

It still shook you when he told you in a letter
That he didn't wanna see you
You nearly lost your mind, oh yeah

Oh, you've lost your lipgloss, honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do can turn him on
There's something wrong
You had it once but now it's gone, oh yeah
Oh, you've lost your lipgloss, honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do can turn him on
There's something wrong
You had it once but now it's gone

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh, ooh
Oh yeah
