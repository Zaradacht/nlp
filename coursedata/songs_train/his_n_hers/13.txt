She, she used to live near his brother
Now she's an unmarried mother
With another on the way
He's second rate
Twisted out of shape
And God, he looks a state
It costs so much to look so rough
They go to town
They like to shop around
And look at all those things
At all those things they never wanted anyway
She hates his hair
That stupid coat he wears
But sometimes second best
Is the best that you can get
Oh yeah, oh, somebody told me

The seconds turn to hours
And the hours turn into days
But still it feels like the morning
The first time leaves its trace
And then slides into second place
Oh, but still it feels like the morning
And at night they try to fly
Hold on tight and close their eyes
And they hit the ground in the morning, yeah

But in the morning it's raining
Oh Christ, you're always complaining
Can't you think of something else? It's nearly-nu
A bargain basement made for two
And if you blur your eyes
You could be anywhere you want yourself to be
Oh yeah, it's bad
I know you want to laugh, so laugh
But sometimes second best
Is all you're going to get
Oh yeah, oh, somebody told me

The seconds turn to hours
And the hours turn into days
Oh, but still it feels like the morning
The first time leaves its trace
And then slides into second place
Oh, but still it feels like the morning
At night they try to fly
Hold on tight and close their eyes
And they hit the ground the morning

But you're so perfect, you don't interest me at all
You're golden boy fell down
And don't you know he hasn't got a personality?
And I know, he said he'd last all night then gave you seconds, yeah

The seconds turn to hours
And the hours turn into days
Oh, but still it feels like the morning
The first time leaves its trace
And then slides into second place
Oh, but still it feels like the morning
And at night they try to fly
Hold on tight and close their eyes
And they hit the ground the morning
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And my God, they're still alive
They got it wrong but they still tried
And they made it through to the morning
