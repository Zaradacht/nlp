You say you've got to go home
'Cos he's sitting on his own again this evening
And I know you're gonna let him bore your pants off again
Oh, now it's half past eight, you'll be late
Oh, but you say you're not sure
Though it makes good sense for you to live together
Still you bought a toy that can reach the places he never goes
And now it's getting late, he's so straight

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now
Ooh

You wanna go home
Well, at least there's someone there that you can talk to
And you never have to face up to the night on your own
Jesus, it must be great to be straight

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now
Ooh

You wanna go home
Oh yeah, you wanna go home
Oh yeah, you wanna go home
You wanna go home

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
But you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now
Ooh, you wanna go home
