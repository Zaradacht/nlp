You'd better watch what you're wearing
If you want him to come round and see you tonight
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
But he doesn't care what it looks like
Just as long as it's pink and it's tight
It's what he likes, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Mm, so what should you do?
Should you stop being you just to be how he wants you?
Mm, go and visit your mum
And tell me that you'll come and meet me in the afternoon
Mm, he's got your heart
You've got his soul, you might as well know

So what?
I know you're never gonna be with me
But do you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time?
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I've gotta be joking
But if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time
You get it right first time

And now you've done it once, now he wants you
To wear your pink glove all the time
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Ooh, so what should you do?
Should you stop being you just to be how he wants you?
Ooh, go and visit your mum
And tell me that you'll come and meet me in the afternoon
Ooh, he's got your heart
You've got his soul, you might as well know

So what?
I know you're never gonna be with me
Oh, do you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time?
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I've gotta be joking
And if you touch him again then I'm going
Ooh, you got it right first time
You get it right first time

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh, you'll always be together
'Cos he gets you up in leather
And you know what to wear at the end of the day
And I'd laugh if I saw, but I'm out of the way
Yeah, it's too long ago, shouldn't care anymore
But I wanted to know, is it as good as before?
Yeah, it's hard to believe that you'd go for that stuff
All those baby-doll nighties, synthetic fluff
Oh, it looks pretty good, yeah, it fits you okay, yeah
Wear your pink glove, babe, you put it on the wrong way!

So?
I know you're never going to be with me
But do you understand now that maybe
You got it right first time?
I realise that you'll never leave him
But every now and then in the evening
You could get it right first time
I know you think I've got to be joking
And if you touch him again then I'm going
Oh, you got it right first time, yeah
Oh, I know that you'll never leave him
Ooh, what do you see in him?
You got it right first time
You get it right first time
