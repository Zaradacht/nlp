We like driving on a Saturday night
Past the leisure centre, left at the lights
Oh, we don't look for trouble, but if it comes we don't run
Looking out for trouble is what we call fun

Hey you, you in the Jesus sandals
Wouldn't you like to
Come over and watch some vandals
Smashing up someone's home?

We can't help it, we're so thick we can't think
Can't think of anything but shit, sleep and drink
Oh, and we like women, "up the women" we say
And if we get lucky, yeah, we might even meet some one day

Oh you, you in the Jesus sandals
Wouldn't you like to
Come over and watch some vandals
Smashing up someone's home?

Mister, we just want your car
'Cos we're taking a girl to the reservoir
Oh, the papers say it's a tragedy
But don't you want to come and see?

Mister, we just want your car
'Cos we're taking a girl to the reservoir
Oh, the papers say it's a tragedy
Mister, we just want your car
Because we're taking a girl to the reservoir
Oh, the papers say it's a tragedy
But don't you wanna come and see?

Mister, we just want your car
'Cos we're taking a girl to the reservoir
Oh, the papers say it's a tragedy
