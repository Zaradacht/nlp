Are you trying to put me on?
I turned around and it was gone
Did I leave it in your car?
On a table in a bar?
Or in your bed between the sheets?
The places where we used to meet
Wherever love has gone I need to know

'Cos she's a woman
Oh yeah, baby, she's a woman
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
She's a lady
Oh, and I just love the way she moves
The way she moves, yeah
Watch her

When you left
I didn't know how I was going to forget you
I was hanging by a thread and then I met her
Selling pictures of herself to German businessmen
Well, that's all she wants to do
Come on, come on
I don't wanna try too hard, I don't wanna wait too long
I don't wanna live alone with all this crap that pulls me down
Oh, tell me now, how would it feel if I could touch you once again

Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
The moon has gone down on the sun
Oh yeah, I know that you're coming home
You couldn't leave me on my own
Everybody, can't you see? She's coming back to me

Whilst you were gone, I got along
I didn't die, I carried on
Oh yeah, You've got to hold me tight
So I can make it through the night
Stayed in bed all day to feel okay, I felt okay

Oh, I felt sick and tired, yes, I did
She lived at her father's place
Played his records, though they jumped
Wore her body back to front
I tried hard to make it work
Kissed her where she said it hurt
But I was always underneath

'Cos she's a woman
Oh yeah, baby, she's a woman
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma
She's a lady
And I just love the way she moves
The way she moves

I don't know why you pretend that it causes you pain
When you know very well you're going to do it again
You're going to do it again, you're going to do it again
And again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And keep it going, going all night long!

Shake it, shake it, shake your body, yeah

Oh, I know it's going to happen
It might not be today, it might not be tomorrow
Or even the day after, but some time soon
You're gonna see, you're gonna
You're gonna, you're gonna
Come back to me!

Whilst you were gone, I got along
I didn't die: I carried on, oh, ma ma ma
Went out drinking every night just so I could feel alright
Stayed in bed all day to feel okay, I felt okay

Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
The moon has gone down, gone down on the sun, oh yeah
I know that you're coming home
You wouldn't leave me on my own
Everybody, can't you see? She's coming back to me

Where have you gone? Where have you gone?
No, I didn't die, oh no, I carried on, yeah, oh oh oh
Working every night just so I could feel alright
Stayed in bed all day, oh, okay

Whilst you were gone, I got along
I didn't die, I carried on
Yeah, I went with other women, what else can I say?
I guess I kind of missed you whilst you were away
Whilst you were...
Gone
Stop
