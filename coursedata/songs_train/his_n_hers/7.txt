Oh hey, imagine it's a film and you're the star
And pretty soon we're coming to the part
Where you realise that you should give your heart
Oh, give your heart to me
And now the orchestra begins to make a sound
It goes round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
And round and round again
And we kiss to violins

Oh, some sad people might believe in that, I guess
Oh, but we know better, don't we, we know all about the mess
The aftermath of our affair is lying all around
And I can't clear it away, no
And do you think it's so easy to find
Somebody who is just your kind
Oh, it might take you a little time, but I'm gonna have to try
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna try

And I know no one can ever know
Which way to head
But don't you remember that you once said
That you liked happy endings, happy endings
And no one can ever know
If it's gonna work
But if you try, if you try
Then you might get your happy ending

And I know no one can ever know
Which way to head
Don't you remember that you once said
That you liked happy endings, happy endings
And no one can ever know
If it's going to work
But if you try, if you try
Then you might get your happy ending
Your ending and everything that you deserve
Oh, and no one can ever know which way to head
But don't you remember that you once said
You liked happy endings
