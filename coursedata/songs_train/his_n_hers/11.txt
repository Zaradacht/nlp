We made our way slowly down the path that led to the stream
Swaying slightly
Drunk on the sun, I suppose
It was a real summer's day, the air humming with heat
Whilst the trees beckoned us into their cool green shade
And when we reached the stream
I put a bottle of cider into the water to chill
Both of us knowing that we'd drink it long before it had a chance

This is where you want to be
There's nothing else but you and her
And how you spend your time

Walking to parties whilst it's still light outside
Peter was upset at first
But now he's in the garden talking to somebody Polish
Why don't we set up a tent and spend the night out there?
And we can pretend that we're somewhere foreign
But we'll still be able to use the fridge, if we get hungry
Or too hot

This is where you want to be
There's nothing else but you and her
And how you spend your time
Oh

We went driving

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Oh

This is where you want to be
There's nothing else but you and her
And how you spend your time
Your time
Your time

The room smells faintly of sun tan lotion in the evening sunlight
And when you take off your clothes
You're still wearing a small pale-skin bikini
The sound of children playing in the park comes from faraway
And time slows down to the speed of the specks of dust
Floating in the light from the window

Summer leaves fall from summer trees
Summer grazes fade on summer knees
Summer nights are slowly getting long
Summer's going so hurry soon it'll be gone

So we went out to the park at midnight one last time
Past the abandoned glasshouse stuffed full of dying palms
Past the bandstand and down to the boating lake
And we swam in the moonlight for what seemed like hours
Until we couldn't swim anymore

And as we came out of the water
We sensed a certain movement in the air
And we both shivered slightly
And we ran to collect our clothes
And as we walked home
We could hear the leaves curling and turning brown on the trees
And the birds deciding where to go for the winter
And the whole sound
The whole sound of summer packing its bags
And preparing to leave town

Ooh, I want you to stay
Oh, please stay for a while
Please stay for a while
Ooh, I want you to stay
Oh, please stay for a while
Please stay for a while
I don't want you to go
Stay
