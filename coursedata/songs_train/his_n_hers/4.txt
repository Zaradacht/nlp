First you let him in your bed
Now he's moved inside your head
And he directs all the dreams you are dreaming
I saw a friend of yours today
She called me over just to say:
"I don't know if you've seen her lately
But god, she's looking rough."

No, don't go round to see him tonight
He's already made such a mess of your life
Find something else to do with your time
And do it quickly while you've still got the chance

Do you think he'll fall apart?
Do you think you'll break his heart?
If you leave him on his own, you are dreaming
'Cos he can fasten all his clothes
Tie his laces, blow his nose
It's time to teach him how to walk
Yeah, teach your baby how to walk away now

No, don't go round to see him tonight
He's already made such a mess of your life
Find something else to do with your time
And do it quickly while you've still got the chance

You're not his mother
And you're not his sister and brother
He's not even your lover
He's just a piece of luggage that you should throw away

No, don't go round to see him tonight
He's already made such a mess of your life
Find something else to do with your time
And do it quickly, oh, while you've still got the chance

No, don't go round tonight, you'll never make it right
He's already made such a mess of your life
And find something else to do with your time
And do it quickly, oh, while you've still got the chance
