I've got the time
And you've got the space
I'm gonna wipe you down
And lick the smile off your face, the smile off your face
Though we know that it's wrong
Towel sets, matching combs
Oh, it looks so good but does it turn you on? Oh
I want you now
And I want you here
Lie down by the fire
And if the neighbours hear, the neighbours hear
'Cos they don't understand
What you've got in your hand
Oh, it looks so good but does it turn you on? Oh yeah

Are we going to do it again?
Sideways
I was stuck in the queue when you came
Delivered me from his and hers
You pulled the units down
Delivered me from his and hers
And when I saw his face
Oh, it made me feel better

Oh, we've gone too far
We gave up hope
And the future's bleak
It's just a soap on a rope, a soap on a rope
Put the rope round his neck
Pull it tight, he's erect
Oh, and it looks so good but does it turn you on? Oh yeah

Are we going to do it again?
Shove it in sideways
I was stuck in the queue when you came
Delivered me from his and hers
You pulled the units down
Delivered me from his and hers
And when I saw his face
Oh, it made me feel better

So we were lying in bed afterwards
And she asked me
What made me frightened
And I said...
I'm frightened of Belgian Chocolates
I'm frightened of potpourri
I'm frightened of James Dean posters
I'm, I'm frightened of 26" screens
I'm frightened of, of remote control
I'm frightened of endowment plans
I'm, I'm frightened of figurines
Ow!
I'm frightened of evenings in the Brincliffe Oaks
Searching for the...
Conversations

"Oh, you're stupid", she said
And she took my hand
And she took her hand and she said
"I want
I want you
I want you to
I want you to touch
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you to..."
Oh!

Are we going to do it again?
Shove it in sideways
I was stuck in the queue when you came
Delivered me from his and hers
You pulled the units down
Delivered me from his and hers
And when I saw his face
It made me feel better
