The trouble with your brother
He's always sleeping with your mother
And I know that your sister
Missed her time again this month
Am I talking too fast or are you just playing dumb?
If you want I can write it down
It shouldn't matter to you, 'cos aren't you the one
Oh, with your razzmatazz and the nights on the town?
Uh oh oh

Oh, you knew it and you blew it, didn't you, babe?
I was lying when I asked you to stay

And now no one's gonna care if you don't call when you said
And he's not coming 'round tonight to try and talk you into bed
And all those stupid little things, they ain't working
No, they ain't working anymore

You started getting fatter
Three weeks after I left you
And now you're, you're going with some kid
Who looks like some bad comedian
Are you gonna go out or are you staying at home
Eating boxes of Milk Tray?
Or watch TV on your own? Oh, aren't you the one
With your razzmatazz and the nights on the town?
Uh oh oh

And your father wants to help you, doesn't he, babe?
But your mother wants to put you away

And now no one's gonna care if you don't call when you said
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed
And all those stupid little things, they ain't working
No, they ain't working anymore

Oh well, I saw you at the doctors
Waiting for a test
You're trying to look like some kind of heiress
But your face is such a mess
And now you're going to a party
And leaving on your own
Oh, I'm sorry but didn't you say
A-things go better with a little bit of razzmatazz?

Ma-ma-mow, mow, ma-mow, mow, mow, mow
Ma-ma-mow, mow, ma-mow, mow, mow, mow, mow
Mow, mow, ma-mow, mow, mow, mow
Ma-ma-mow, mow, ma-mow, mow
And now no one's gonna care if you don't call when you said
And he's not coming round tonight to try and talk you into bed
Now it's half past ten in the evening
And you wish that you were dead
'Cos all those stupid little things, they ain't working
No, they ain't working anymore
