I woke up to the morning sky, first
Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground, I shake leaves back down
To the brown, brown, brown, brown
'Til I’m clean

[Verse 2]
Then I walk where I'd be shaded by the trees
By a meadow of green
For about a mile
I'm headed to town, town, town
In style

[Chorus]
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers
See ’em like no other
All my favorite colors

[Post-Chorus]
It's a good day (To be)
A good day for me (A good day for me)
A good day to see (A good day to see)
My favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers (My sisters and my brothers)
They see 'em like no other (See 'em like no other)
All my favorite colors

[Verse 3]
Now take me to other side
Little bitty blues bird flies
And gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
We gon' fly, feel alright

[Verse 4]
And we gon'
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yeah
It sound like
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yeah
The least I can say, I anticipate
A homecoming parade as we renegade
In the morning, right on

[Chorus]
With all my favorite colors (All my favorite colors) yes, sir
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors) yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers (My sisters and my brothers)
See 'em like no other (See ’em like no other)
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors)
Right
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors) yes, ma’am
My sisters and my brothers (My sisters and my brothers)
See 'em like no other (See ’em like no other)
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors)

[Post-Chorus]
It's a good day to be (A good day to be)
A good day for me (A good day for me)
A good day to see my favorite colors (A good day to see my favorite colors)
Colors
My sisters and my brothers
They see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
